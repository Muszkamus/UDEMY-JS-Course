// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in const 1 = " and convert them to camelCase.

The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.

THIS TEST DATA (pasted to textarea)
const 1 = "
 first_name
So"me_Variable 
  calculate_AGE
delayed_departure

SHOULD PRODUCE THIS OUTPUT (5 separate console.log outputs)
underscoreCase      âœ…
firstName           âœ…âœ…
someVariable        âœ…âœ…âœ…
calculateAge        âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…
delayedDeparture    âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…âœ…

HINT 1: Remember which character defines a new line in the textarea ðŸ˜‰
HINT 2: The solution only needs to work for a variable made out of 2 words, like a_b
HINT 3: Start without worrying about the âœ…. Tackle that only after you have the variable name conversion working ðŸ˜‰
HINT 4: This challenge is difficult on purpose, so start watching the solution in case you're stuck. Then pause and continue!

Afterwards, test with your own test data!

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
