JS Engine - PRogram that exetuses javascript code.
Most popular is Google V8

CallStack- Our code is executed, used by execution context.

Heap -Unstructured memory pool,which stored all the objects that app needs.

How is the code compiled to the machine code-
Compilation - Entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer (fast).
Interpretation- Interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line (slow).
